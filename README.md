## Overview
Every streaming content has its own viewers and each content has it's rating. Viewers leave some good ratings for the content if they like it. But where does it apply? Viewers can spend hours scrolling through hundreds, sometimes thousands of anime's never finding an content they like. Business need to be provided suggestions based on their likes and needs in order to create a better streaming environment that boosts revenue and increases the time spent on a website.

## Motivation
What could be a perfect way to utilize unfortunate lockdown period? I was getting bored working on business problem statements. I decided to take a short break from the chaos and work on a project that can be fun and quite interesting. I love watching animes and always wondered'what's next' after completing each series. So here I tried my best in building my own recommendation so that I don't have to google anymore

## Objectives of project
1. Meet and greet data 
2. Analyze the data
3. Preparing data for consumption
4. Recommendation building phase
